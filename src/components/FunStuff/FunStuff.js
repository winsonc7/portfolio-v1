But among these seemingly endless search methods, is there one that deserves to be called the best? One that reigns supreme over them all? The answer is yes. Don't believe me? Watch the video to experience the genius behind my favorite search algorithm and see for yourself."

This is one of my favorite videos on the internet: it builds foundation with the Hilbert's Hotel paradox, gives an intuitive explanation of the diagonalization argument, and presents a mind-boggling proof thanks to the mysterious workings of uncountable infinity. Enjoy!"
