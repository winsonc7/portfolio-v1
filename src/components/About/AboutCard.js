            Hi there! Thanks for visiting my portfolio! My name's Winson, and I'm a <span className="about-bold">junior at Stanford University</span> studying CS in the fields of <span className="about-bold">AI and Theory</span>. I'm also a <span className="about-bold">first-year masters student</span> studying Management Science & Engineering with a concentration in <span className="about-bold">computational finance</span>. As a fan of all things coding and theory, I love nothing more than building efficient programs that tackle difficult problems using innovative solutions.
