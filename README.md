# Basic Portfolio

This is a temporary portfolio to list my projects, experiences, etc. while I continue working on my passion project portfolio -- Portfolio v.1, so to speak. I did all site design and development, although the original site framework is inspired by Soumyajit Behera.

## 2/13/24 Update

The first iteration of the website is complete! Go ahead and check it out at [winsonc7.github.io](winsonc7.github.io)! There's still more work to be done however, ESPECIALLY with the cleanliness of the code (it's a bit of a garbage fire within the files right now) so if you scan through the code please be lenient with me üôè
